# TechNest Retailers-Acquisition-Financial-Model -  Investment Banking Simulation

## Project Overview
This project explains and discusses an M&A scenario where Big Tech Retails aims to acquire TechNest Retailers, a fictional company I created to practice M&A financial forecasting and modelling. As part of an investment banking simulation, I took on the role of an M&A analyst to develop a financial model for the potential acquisition. The financial statements used are fictitious, and I designed the company specifically to apply my financial forecasting and modeling skills, and knowledge through this project.


## Company Profile
TechNest Retailers is a leading U.S.-based electronics and appliance retailer that has been serving customers for over five decades. Founded in 1966, TechNest Retailers has grown from a small regional electronics store to a national retail powerhouse with over 1,100 locations across the United States. The company specializes in offering a wide range of consumer electronics, home appliances, and personal technology solutions, making it a go-to destination for tech enthusiasts and everyday consumers alike.

TechNest Retailers prides itself on providing exceptional customer service, competitive pricing, and an expansive selection of top-tier electronics brands. The company has successfully adapted to the evolving retail landscape by incorporating an omnichannel retail strategy, enabling customers to shop seamlessly online or in-store. In recent years, TechNest Retailers has invested heavily in e-commerce and digital transformation initiatives, to meet the growing demand for online shopping and to enhance customer convenience through faster delivery and personalized shopping experiences.


#### Financial Health and Growth Potential:
Over the next five years, TechNest Retailers is projected to see its revenue grow to $83.36 billion, driven by enhanced operational efficiency and an expanding customer base. The company’s profitability metrics, such as EBITDA and Net Income, are forecasted to grow significantly, signaling strong financial health and growth potential. With low levels of debt and a stable interest expense of just $25 million annually, TechNest Retailers has positioned itself as an attractive merger and acquisition (M&A) candidate for any company looking to expand its market share in the electronics retail space.

TechNest Retailers is an ideal company for any firm looking to merge with a well-established retailer that has a robust infrastructure, a proven business model, and significant growth potential in the evolving world of consumer technology and e-commerce.

## Financial Forecasting
My plan for this project is to create a financial forecast for the next 5 years, starting in 2024. I'll build a 5-year revenue and expense model for TechNest Retailers using a simple income statement in Excel.


## Skills Demonstrated
The following skills listed below are the skills that are demonstrated to complete the project:
- Financial modelling (Excel)
- M&A Strategy
- Forecasting
- Company Research


## Income statement Drivers
These are the key factors or variables that have a significant impact on the revenue, expenses, and overall profitability of a company, as reflected in the income statement. These drivers help determine how much income a company will generate and what costs will be incurred.

### Understanding Financial Forecasting: Constant vs. Variable Line Items

In financial forecasting, determining which line items remain constant and which are projected to change is crucial for accurate modeling. This differentiation hinges on the company's operational strategies, market conditions, and efficiency expectations. Here’s an insightful look into this process:

#### Constant Line Items:

1. Depreciation:

Depreciation is tied to fixed assets and their estimated useful life. Holding it constant at 1.5% of revenue implies a stable asset base, suggesting that the company does not anticipate significant new investments in fixed assets, allowing for consistent revenue generation.

2. Amortization:

Typically associated with intangible assets, holding amortization at $100 million indicates a predictable amortization schedule. This suggests that the company expects no significant acquisitions of intangible assets during the forecast period.

3. Interest Expense:

A stable interest expense of $25 million indicates no changes in debt levels or borrowing strategies. This reflects a focus on maintaining existing financial obligations without incurring additional debt.


#### Variable Line Items:

1. Revenue Growth:

Projecting a 10% year-over-year growth reflects optimism about market expansion and strategic initiatives aimed at increasing market share. This represents the proactive management of opportunities in a dynamic environment.

2. COGS % Revenue:

The decline in COGS from 77% to 76% indicates anticipated improvements in operational efficiency, possibly through technological advancements or better supplier negotiations. This reflects a proactive approach to cost management.

3. SG&A % Revenue:

The reduction in SG&A expenses from 16.5% to 16% showcases the company’s commitment to optimizing operational spending. This may involve strategic cost-cutting and enhanced marketing effectiveness to improve overall productivity.

4. Tax Rate:
   
The tax rate, applied consistently at 20% across the forecast period, plays a key role in determining the company's net income after taxes. This rate reflects the percentage of pre-tax income (or earnings before taxes, EBT) that is paid to the government. Maintaining a stable tax rate allows for a clearer projection of future cash flows and profitability.

   Here’s the general formula for calculating the tax rate:

##### = Taxes Paid/ Pre-Tax Income (or EBT)

## Conclusion: Is TechNest Retailers a Suitable Candidate for Merger?

Based on the financial analysis, TechNest Retailers appears to be a strong candidate for an acquisition, as well as a merger. The company’s consistent revenue growth, strong profitability metrics, and established market presence align well with strategic objectives for companies seeking to expand their retail footprint. However, it is crucial to conduct a thorough due diligence process to assess integration capabilities and market positioning before proceeding.


Based on the 5-year financial forecast, TechNest Retailers seems to be a strong company to buy, but let’s break it down simply:

Revenues: The company's revenues are growing steadily each year, from $51.8 billion in 2024 to $83.4 billion in 2029. This shows that the business is expanding and increasing its sales.

Gross Profit and Margin: Gross profit also rises, meaning the company is making more money after deducting the costs of goods sold (COGS). The margin improves slightly over time, indicating that TechNest is becoming more efficient in controlling costs.

EBITDA: EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) increases from $3.9 billion to $6.7 billion by 2029. This is a good sign, as it shows the company’s core operations are becoming more profitable.

Net Income: The net income (what's left after all expenses, including taxes and interest, are paid) increases from $2.4 billion in 2024 to $4.2 billion in 2029. This means the company is making more profit each year.



TechNest Retailers is steadily growing its revenues, profits, and margins over the next five years. Its operations are becoming more efficient, and profits are increasing, which makes it an attractive asset to consider for acquisition. It looks like a solid company to buy based on this forecast.
